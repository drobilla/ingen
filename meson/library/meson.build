# Meson's default_library option doesn't support shared and static builds very
# well.  In particular, it's often necessary to define different symbols for
# static and shared builds of libraries so that symbols can be exported.  To
# work around this, default_library=both isn't supported on Windows.  On other
# platforms with GCC-like compilers, we can support both because symbols can
# safely be exported in the same way (giving them default visibility) in both
# static and shared builds.

# Set library_suffix to the suffix for libraries
if host_system == 'windows' and default_library == 'shared'
  # Meson appends a version to the name only for DLLs, which leads to
  # inconsistent library names, like `mylib-1-1`.  So, provide no suffix to
  # ultimately get the same name as on other platforms, like `mylib-1`.
