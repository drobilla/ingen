# Ingen Internal Plugins
# Copyright (C) 2008 David Robillard <http://drobilla.net>
#
# This document describes internal plugins that are implemented in
# Ingen itself.  This set is deliberately as small as possible: an
# internal plugin exists only because there is no sufficiently powerful
# plugin specification to do its job.  Ingen's philosophy is that this is
# a bug to be fixed, e.g. by defining LV2 extensions.

Receives events and outputs signals for some specific controller
(e.g. MIDI CC).

Receives events and outputs a trigger signal when a specific note is received.

:NotePlugin a :Plugin ;
    rdfs:label "Note" ;
    rdfs:comment """
Receives events and outputs signals for the individual properties of the
received notes.  This plugin is special because it is internally aware of
Ingen's polyphony and controls voice allocation.
""" .

:TransportPlugin a :Plugin ;
    rdfs:label "Transport" ;
    rdfs:comment """
Listens to system transport information  (when available) and outputs signals
for the various transport properties.  When no system transport information
is available this plugin outputs "default" values: 4/4, 120bpm.
