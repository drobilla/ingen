This directory contains the core engine/client interfaces, code used on
both the engine side and client side.

It's very, very important that nothing here gets messed up that violates
client/engine separation.  All interfaces use simple messages composed of
serializable types.

The interface here maps directly on to the OSC interface - except it can
happen in the same process as well, with only (virtual) function call
overhead.
