This directory is code that could POSSIBLY be used by both the engine and
clients.

It's very, very important that nothing here gets messed up that violates
client/engine separation.  All interfaces use simple messages composed of
serializable types, and no binary data that could break is shared.  It's
basically a functional version of a human-readable OSC interface, in both
directions.

The interface here maps directly on to the OSC interface - except it can
happen in the same process as well, with only (virtual) function call
overhead.
