These are example patches, loadable by the gtk client.

I consider patches to be a form of art, thus all files in this folder are
released into the public domain.  If you modify any of them, I would
appreciate a copy for inclusion into the distribution, but you're in no
way obligated to do so.

(I would really appreciate receiving any user patches of course, derived
from these or not)
