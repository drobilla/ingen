Thanks goes to (in alphabetical order):

Krzysztof Foltman (kfoltman), for much needed modularey plugins, and testing.

Lachlan Davis (LFactor), for driving development forward through being a nuisance. :)
(And somehow tolerating the dodgiest early stages of development and actually
building some neat patches, being 100% of the existing userbase for a time...)

Lars Luthman (larsl), lots of DSSI improvements and useful plugins.

Leonard Ritter (paniq), Old Python bindings

Mario Lang (delYsid), SuperCollider bindings

Paul Davis and friends, for Jack.

Steve Harris (swh), for liblo and good networking ideas, helpful suggestions
in general.

Thorsten Wilms (thorwil), for much UI input, mockups and glade widgets.

Everyone in #lad who puts up with my idiocy on a daily basis.

Everyone who's ever written a Free plugin.
