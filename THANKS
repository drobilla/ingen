Thanks goes to, in no particular order:

Steve Harris (swh), for liblo and good networking ideas, helpful suggestions
in general.

Lachlan Davis (LFactor), for driving development forward through being a nuisance. :)
(And somehow tolerating the dodgiest early stages of development and actually
building some neat patches, being 100% of the existing userbase for a time...)

Thorsten Wilms (thorwil), for much UI input, mockups and glade widgets.

Lars Luthman (larsl), lots of DSSI improvements.

Mario Lang (delYsid), SuperCollider bindings

Leonard Ritter (paniq), Python bindings

Paul Davis and friends, for Jack.

Everyone in #lad who puts up with my idiocy on a daily basis.

Everyone who's ever written a LADSPA/DSSI plugin.
