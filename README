Om is a realtime modular synthesizer and/or effects processor for
Jack/Alsa/LADSPA/DSSI/LV2/etc (ie GNU/Linux audio systems).  More information
may be found at http://om-synth.nongnu.org

To build, do the typical "./configure; make; make install" routine.

Check "./configure --help" for options, you can build this code in many
different ways (standalone engine with seperate clients, build engine only,
build clients only, build monolithic clients, etc. etc)


*** Optimization ***

Om's configure script, by default, does not clobber your CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS
environment variables (which is the proper behaviour), though it does add a
few flags that should be turned on in any case (as described in this file).
If you want to submit usable bug reports (for segfaults and the like),
build with --enable-debug.  This will also enable assertions, which also
makes bug hunting easier (see below).

SIMD (SSE/Altivec):

If you have GCC4, it is HIGHLY recommended that you enable your SIMD
instruction set (ie "-march=pentium4 -mfpmath=sse" in the case of a P4 with
SSE) through your CXXFLAGS environment variable.  The performance improvement
(and denormal avoidance if you have a P4) is drastic.


*** Debugging ***

Om makes very heavy use of assertions to catch bugs.  Assertions have a
(minor) performance hit unless the preprocessor symbol NDEBUG is defined.
By default the configure script will add this to the end of your flags,
but it's worth noting.  You really don't want assertions turned on in a
production build.  However, if you encounter a bug (especially a segfault)
it would be a good idea to rebuild with --enable-debug, chances are you'll
hit an assertion and the console output will be a sufficient bug report so
I can fix the problem.


*** Bugs ***

If Om crashes, PLEASE REPORT THE BUG.  This isn't software from some faceless
corporation, I'm a real person, and I'm usually on IRC (#lad on freenode.net)
if you want to talk to me.  Things can't get fixed if I don't know about them,
and if you report it, it will get fixed - probably immediately.

I write these tens of thousands of lines of code and give it to you completely
Free, the least you could to is tell me how she goes :)

Have fun...
