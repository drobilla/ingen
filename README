Om is a realtime modular synthesizer for Jack/Alsa/LADSPA/DSSI (ie GNU/Linux
audio systems).  More information may be found at http://om-synth.nongnu.org

To build, do the typical "./configure; make; make install" routine - check
"./configure --help" for options.

You can build just the engine (and avoid all the gtk/libxml/etc dependancies)
by doing the same in the src/engine directory.


*** Optimisation ***

Om's configure script, by default, does not clobber your CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS
environment variables (which is the proper behaviour), though it does add
a few flags that should be turned on in any case.

SIMD (SSE/Altivec):

If you have GCC4, it is HIGHLY recommended that you enable your SIMD
instruction set (ie "-march=pentium4 -mfpmath=sse" in the case of a P4
with SSE) through your CXXFLAGS environment variable.  The performance
improvement (and denormal avoidance if you have a P4) is significant.


Debugging:

Om makes very heavy use of assertions to catch bugs.  Assertions have a
performance hit unless the preprocessor symbol NDEBUG is defined.  By default
the configure script will add this to the end of your flags, but it's worth
noting.  You really don't want assertions turned on in a production build.
However, if you encounter a bug (especially a segfault) it would be a good
idea to rebuild with --enable-debug, chances are you'll hit an assertion and
the console output will be a sufficient bug report so I can fix the problem.


*** Bugs ***

If Om crashes, REPORT THE BUG.  Things can't get fixed if I don't know about
them, and if you report it, it will get fixed - probably immediately.

Please, report the bug.  There's a nice form on the Savannah page to do so,
no mailing required.
